# Breast Cancer Detection Model
This repository contains a trained Logistic Regression model for predicting breast cancer using 5 key features:
- Mean Radius
- Mean Texture
- Mean Perimeter
- Mean Area
- Mean Smoothness
## Files
- `model.pkl`: Trained model
- `scaler.pkl`: StandardScaler used for preprocessing
- `train_model.py`: Training script
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for setup
## Next Steps
This model will be deployed via Flask and connected to a React frontend for real-time predictions.
